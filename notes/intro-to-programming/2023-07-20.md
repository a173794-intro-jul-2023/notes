Object Oriented Programming

Procedural Programming
- Decisions, loops, variables

- Data (state)
- Code that works on that data (behavior)

- OOP says whenever possible, relate those two
	- Create a capsule of data and related behavior

- If you have some data and you want to do something with it, that data should know how to do it

- "Cohesion" - making sure that the behaviors of a type are related to the data of that type


.NET - 
- We create "Types"
	- References
		- Live on the heap
		- Created with classes (and records)
	- Values
		- numbers (int, double, single, float)
		- DateTime
		- You can create new values by creating a struct
		- These live on the stack

Classes define the two things an object can have:
- data (state)
- behavior (methods, properties, and constructors)

overridable: means that the methods can be overridden by classes that inherit that class

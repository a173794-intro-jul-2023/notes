.NET
- Object oriented
- One of the most commonly used programming language at Prog
- For code reviews, it's important to show the tests
- Can't put code into production that you can't test
-  .NET Core
- Solution- a container for one or more project, each project contains an assembly
- Each Project can contain solutions

PascalCase - Assembly names, namespaces, public things like classes
cammelCase - local variables

.NET Support
- Long Term Support (LTS) - 3 years
- Standard Term Support (STS) - 18 months

Parts of Project
- Solution file
	- .sln
- .vs folder
	- configurations for the visual studio
- Project folder
	- Contains the code for the project
	- .csproj: XML document that specifies the SDK, version, and output of an assembly
	- dll: Library files
- Bin
	- When compile project, goes to the bin file
	- Info for the debugger, dependencies, executable

- Program.cs is the entry point for a C# project

Command Line
-` dotnet new --list` list commands
- `dotnet new console -o SecondApp` create the project

Four Rules of Simple Design:
1) Passes the tests (works right)
	- Write the simplest thing
	- Tests should be written to answer for requirements
1) Reveals intention
	- Code should be obvious
	- Can you understand what the code is created for?
2) No duplication
	- Don't repeat the same code, create functions for it!
3) Fewest elements
	- Variables, loops, if statements, etc.
	- This is where bugs hide :(


- API catalog
- npm packages stored in artifactory with stuff built already


Testing
- Any public void method that has the [Fact] identifier is run as a test. If it doesn't throw and exception, it passes the test
- Run test by Test -> Run All Tests

- Three sections of a test
	- Given
		- 
	- When (System Under Test)
	- Then

- Types of tests
	- Fact - test if given inputs it produces a result
	- Theory - one test with multiple inputs

Test First Development
- Red
	- Start by writing a meaningly failing test - it fails on the assert of the test
- Green
	- Get the test to pass
	- Don't worry about writing good code at this point, just get the test to pass
- Refactor
	- Make the code better
	- Don't add new functionality during this step
	- Good idea to make a commit before the next step so you have something to roll back to
